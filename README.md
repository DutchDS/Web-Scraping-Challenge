Web Scraping Challenge!

What a fun assignment this was. I could barely stop working on it and kept (read keep) on seeing things that could look better. For the homework assignment, please use the Mission_To_Mars folder (and not the Mission_To_Mars_II_HEROKU folder!!)

The index.html file only works actively, if it is started from Flask (by running app.py from a python shell). When clicking "Scrape new data", 5 websites will be scraped.
The returned information is stored in  a mongoDB database and in turn read by the index.html file to reflect the most current information.

Here are 4 screenshots of the output, since refreshing the index.html only works with an active: http://127.0.0.1:5000/ port running and the required files in place.
For my private website, I saved the .html output to a separate file, so that the it would be visible when clicked on. Refreshing however only works if the app.py etc. is running in place.
